	<h3 class="title">Yom Ha'Atzma'ut / Yom HaZikaron 2007</h3>
	<div class="posted">Posted by mradwin at January 23, 2007 09:22 PM
        | <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/news/2007/01/yom_haatzmaut_yom_hazikaron_2007.html">Link to this article</a>
	</div>
	
	<p>The Israeli government changed the dates of <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/holidays/yom-hazikaron.html">Yom HaZikaron</a> and <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/holidays/yom-haatzmaut.html">Yom Ha'atzmaut</a> a couple of years ago. They added a new rule to prevent Yom HaZikaron from beginning on motzei Shabbat. In 2007, these holidays begin at sundown on 22 and 23 April, respectively (the 5th and 6th of Iyyar).</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/MemorialDayLaw_eng.htm#1">Memorial Day and Independence Day Bill (amendment) 2004</a> for an English translation of the law that the Knesset passed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Ha%27atzmaut#Timing">Wikipedia article on Yom Ha'atzmaut</a> explains the recent change, and their dates agree with ours. Here the relevant excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>Yom Ha'atzmaut falls on the 5th day of Iyar on the Hebrew calendar, the anniversary of the day in which Israel independence was proclaimed, when David ben Gurion publicly read the Proclamation of the establishment of the State of Israel. The corresponding Gregorian date was May 14, 1948.

<p>The festival is celebrated on the Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday closest to that date. This is to avoid having the festival either on Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath, or immediately before or after it. If Iyar 5 falls on Saturday, the festival is advanced to Thursday, Iyar 3, and if on Friday, then it is advanced to Thursday, Iyar 4. In 2004, the law was changed to provide that if Iyar 5 falls on Monday, the festival is postponed to Tuesday Iyar 6, so that Yom Hazikaron will not be immediately after the sabbath. (The rules of the Hebrew calendar are such that Iyar 5 does not fall on Sunday.)</blockquote></p>

<p>If you're using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hebcal/">hebcal for UNIX</a>, be sure to upgrade to version 3.7 to see the updated rules for these two holidays.<br />

Sir,
We are Jewish soldiers stationed in Baghdad, Iraq and were wondering if you
would consider adding Baghdad to your list of cities for candle lighting
times.  It is a wondrous event to be Jews in Baghdad observing our faith and
to be recognized on your website would be an honor.

Thank you on behalf of the Victory Base Jewish Community.

B'Shalom

	<p>Israel ruled Feb. 1 to move the Day of Remembrance (Yom Hazikaron) and Israel Independence Day (Yom Ha'atzmaut) to Monday, April 26 and Tuesday, April 27 to avoid possible Shabbat violations in the country.</p>

<p>Following the Feb. 1 ruling, Rabbi Gedaliah Dov Schwartz of the Rabbinical Council of America issued a ruling saying American Jews should observe the holidays without adjusting to Israel's schedule. [<a href="http://www.ijn.com/archive/2004%20arch/040204.htm#story1">IJN</a>]</p>

	<p>Thanks to Alan Ziv, an error in the <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/vayigash.html">Vayigash</a> full kriyah aliyot list has been fixed.</p>

<p>The corrected list looks like this:</p>

<p>1: 44:18-30 (13 p'sukim)<br />
2: 44:31-45:7 (11 p'sukim)<br />
3: 45:8-18 (11 p'sukim)<br />
4: 45:19-27 (9 p'sukim)<br />
5: 45:28-46:27 (28 p'sukim)<br />
6: 46:28-47:10 (17 p'sukim)<br />
7: 47:11-27 (17 p'sukim)<br />
maf: 47:25-27 (3 p'sukim)</p>

<p>Previously the website had incorrectly listed the third, fourth and fifth aliyot as:</p>

<p>3:  45:8-27 (20 p'sukim)<br />

	</div>
	
	<p>Due to some confusion with Israeli vs. Diaspora sedra schemes, I have modified the user interface on the Interactive Calendar page to make the option easier to use.  Instead of a checkbox, it's now displayed as a radio button (a choice between the two options).</p>

<form><label for="s"><input type="checkbox" name="s" value="on" id="s">
Weekly sedrot on Saturdays</label>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<input type="radio" name="i" value="off" checked>&#10;Diaspora <input type="radio" name="i" value="on">&#10;Israel &nbsp;<small>(<a href="http://www.hebcal.com/help/sedra.html">What is the difference?</a>)</small></form>

<p>You should select the appropriate option depending on where you live (Israeli sedra scheme for those living inside Israel, Diaspora for everyone else).</p>

<p>I have also fixed the 1-Click Shabbat service (both <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/shabbat/">web</a> and <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/email/">email</a> versions) to automatically select Israeli sedra scheme for cities in Israel.</p>

Subject: Tellme Studio program change

VoiceXML Developer,

Tellme has made many investments in VoiceXML over the past four years. 
One of these investments was in the Extensions program, with the goal 
of making VoiceXML a more utilized public standard. Now with VoiceXML 
well on its way to standardization in the W3C and with hundreds of 
thousands of VoiceXML applications in production,  it is clear that 
investment has paid off. It is time for us to retire the Extensions 
program and invest in other areas. As of Wednesday, April 9th we will 
no longer host Extensions on 1-800-555-TELL or 
<a href="http://studio.tellme.com">http://studio.tellme.com</a>. Developers can continue to build VoiceXML 
applications on Tellme Studio.

Thank you for your individual contribution in making VoiceXML the most 
widely-used and successful voice standard in the world.

The Tellme Development Team

See <a title="Torah Reading for 18 January 2003" href="http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/beshalach.html">Parashat Beshalach</a> (this week's parsha) as an example.  You'll see a link <a name="prev" href="http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/bo.html" title="Torah Reading for 11 January 2003">&lt;&lt; Bo</a> on the left and <a name="next" href="http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/yitro.html" title="Torah Reading for 25 January 2003">Yitro &gt;&gt;</a> on the right.</p>

<p>These links have always been available at the bottom of the parsha pages, but now they're also visible at the top for people who don't like to scroll.</p>

<p>Also, the date of the reading for the current year <span style="background: #ffff99">highlighted</span> to easily see what to year we're in if you're using the triennial cycle.</p>

	<p>We've added the ability to get candle lighting times for your city as an RSS feed (for use in news aggegator programs like <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand </a>, <a href="http://www.feedreader.com/">FeedReader</a>, <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>, or <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>.</p>

<p>Simply go to the <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/shabbat/">1-Click Shabbat Candle Lighting Times</a> page, enter your zip code, and hit Submit.  You'll notice this little orange XML button (example: <img src="http://www.hebcal.com/i/xml.gif" border="0" alt="View the raw XML source" width="36" height="14">) in the upper right corner of the page.</p>

	<p>Sometime before Pesach, I hope to change the <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/">Hebcal Torah Readings</a> pages to correctly show special haftara/maftir when the parsha corresponds with a special day like Rosh Chodesh or Shabbat Shekalim.</p>

<p>Currently we're displaying this message:</p>

<blockquote>NOTE: This site does not yet indicate special maftir or haftarah when they occur. Always check a luach or consult with your rabbi to determine if this Shabbat has a special maftir and/or a special haftarah.</blockquote>

<p>But of course it would be much better if the website actually had the proper data.  This would make hebcal.com one step closer to being a full luach.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of other <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=350340&group_id=340&func=browse">feature requests</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100340&group_id=340&func=browse">bugs</a> to fix this year, too.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Fixed broken RSS for 1-Click Shabbat</h3>
	<div class="posted">Posted by mradwin at December 31, 2002 05:51 PM

	<p>I got an email from Bill Kearney at Syndic8.com about a small error with the RSS feed from 1-Click Shabbat:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.syndic8.com/feedinfo.php?FeedID=21674">http://www.syndic8.com/feedinfo.php?FeedID=21674</a> </p>

<p>Apparently I had a broken ISO date format; timezone formatting was using -8:00 instead of the correct -08:00 format.  It's been fixed.</p>

<p>Gotta love that sprintf("%02d") stuff.  :-)</p>
