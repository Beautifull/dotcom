<h3><a name="adar"></a>How does Hebcal determine an anniversary occurring
in Adar?</h3>

<p><a

vspace="8" border="0"></a> Hebcal uses the algorithm defined in <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521777526/ref=nosim/hebcal-20">Calendrical
Calculations</a></em> by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.</p>

<h4><a name="bd"></a>Birthday</h4>

<p>Reingold and Dershowitz write:</p>

<blockquote>
The birthday of someone born in Adar of an ordinary year or Adar II
of a leap year is also always in the last month of the year, be that
Adar or Adar II.

The birthday in an ordinary year of someone born during the first 29
days of Adar I in a leap year is on the corresponding day of Adar; in
a leap year, the birthday occurs in Adar I, as expected.

Someone born on the thirtieth day of Marcheshvan, Kislev, or Adar I
has his birthday postponed until the first of the following month in
years where that day does not occur.

[<em>Calendrical Calculations</em> p. 111]
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="yahrzeit"></a>Yahrzeit</h4>

<p>The rule for a Yahrzeit is a little different:</p>

<blockquote>
The customary anniversary date of a death is more complicated and
depends also on the character of the year in which the first
anniversary occurs. There are several cases:

<ul>
<li>If the date of death is Marcheshvan 30, the anniversary in general
depends on the <em>first</em> anniversary; if that first anniversary was
not Marcheshvan 30, use the day before Kislev 1.

<li>If the date of death is Kislev 30, the anniverary in general again
depends on the first anniverary -- if that was not Kislev 30, use the
day before Tevet 1.

<li>If the date of death is Adar II, the anniversary is the same day in
the last month of the Hebrew year (Adar or Adar II).

<li>If the date of death is Adar I 30, the anniversary in a Hebrew year
that is not a leap year (in which Adar only has 29 days) is the last
day in Shevat.

<li>In all other cases, use the normal (that is, same month number) anniverary of the
date of death.
</ul>

[<em>Calendrical Calculations</em> p. 113]
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="ex1"></a>Yahrzeit Example</h4>

<p>For example, suppose Ploni ben Ploni passed away on 14 March
2001. That date corresponds to the 19th of Adar, 5761. Since 5761 was
not a leap year, there was only one Adar that year (i.e. the date of
death occurred in 12th month of the Hebrew year).</p>

<p>Suppose one wishes to observe the yahrzeit in Hebrew year 5765. Since
5765 is a leap year and none of the other rules applies, we use the same
month number as the date of death. In a leap year the 12th month is Adar
I, so the yahrzeit is observed on 19th of Adar I, 5765 (28 February
2005).</p>

<h4><a name="var"></a>Variations</h4>

<p>On page 114, Reingold and Dershowitz write:</p>

<blockquote>
There are minor variations in custom regarding the anniversary date
in some of these cases. For example, Spanish and Portuguese Jews never
observe the anniversary of a common-year date in Adar I.
</blockquote>

<p>There are undoubtedly many
differing opinions regarding when to observe an Adar yahrzeit. For all
matters of halacha, consult your local rabbi.</p>
