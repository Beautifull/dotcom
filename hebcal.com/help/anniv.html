<h1>Hebrew Anniversaries: Yahrzeits and Birthdays</h1>

<h3><a name="adar"></a>How does Hebcal determine an anniversary occurring
in Adar?</h3>

<p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521777526/ref=nosim/hebcal-20"><img

src="http://www.hebcal.com/i/0521777526.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" hspace="8"
vspace="8" border="0"></a> Hebcal uses the algorithm defined in <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521777526/ref=nosim/hebcal-20">Calendrical
Calculations</a></em> by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.  The
authors write (p. 111):</p>

<blockquote>
The birthday of someone born in Adar of an ordinary year or Adar II
of a leap year is also always in the last month of the year, be that
Adar or Adar II. Someone born on the thirtieth day of Cheshvan,
Kislev, or Adar I has his birthday postponed until the first of the
following month in years where that day does not occur.
</blockquote>

<p>The rule for a Yahrzeit is similar (p. 113):</p>

<blockquote>
The customary anniversary date of a death is more complicated and
depends also on the character of the year in which the first
anniversary occurs. There are several cases:

<ol>
<li>If the date of death is Cheshvan 30, the anniversary in general
depends on the <em>first</em> anniversary; if that first anniversary was
not Chesvan 30, use the day before Kislev 1.

<li>If the date of death is Kislev 30, the anniverary in general again
depends on the first anniverary -- if that was not Kislev 30, use the
day before Tevet 1.

<li>If the date of death is Adar II, the anniversary is the same day in
the last month of the Hebrew year (Adar or Adar II).

<li>If the date of death is Adar I 30, the anniversary in a Hebrew year
that is not a leap year (in which Adar only has 29 days) is the last
day in Shevat.

<li>In all other cases, use the normal (birthday) anniverary of the
date of death.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>On page 114, they write:</p>

<blockquote>
There are minor variations in custom regarding the anniversary date
in some of these cases. For example, Spanish and Portuguese Jews never
observe the anniversary in Adar I.
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, a note from the Hebcal authors: there are undoubtedly many
differing opinions regarding when to observe an Adar yahrzeit. For all
matters of halacha, consult your local rabbi.</p>
