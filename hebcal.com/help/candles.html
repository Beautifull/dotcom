<h1>Candle lighting times</h1>
<!--/htdig_noindex-->

<h3><a name="shabbat"></a>When does Shabbat begin?</h3>

<p>Shabbat begins 18 minutes before sundown on Friday night.  In
Jerusalem, Shabbat begins 40 minutes before sundown.</p>

<h3><a name="havdalah"></a>What is Havdalah (or, When does Shabbat
end)?</h3>

<p>Shabbat ends after sundown on Saturday night when there are three
stars visible.  Depending on latitude and longitude, this is usually
between 42 and 72 minutes after sundown.

<h3><a name="accurate"></a>How accurate are candle lighting
times?</h3>

<p>Hebcal computes sunset based on an algorithm by the U.S. Naval
Observatory (USNO). The USNO claims accuracy within 2 minutes except at
extreme northern or southern latitudes.  Comparison to local NWS charts
for sunrise and sunset (which are cheap and easy to come by) shows that
with the double precision calculations, the charts produced by this
program are no more than 1 minute removed from those charts in
lattitudes lower than 41 degrees.  Candle lighting times agree with
those on popular calendars also to the 1 minute accuracy.</p>

<p>That said, the USNO algorithm can only approximate the
candle-lighting times for your location.  If you ever have any doubts
about Hebcal's times, consult your local halachic authority.</p>

<h3><a name="zip2geo"></a>How are candle lighting times determined from
my zip code?</h3>

<p>Since candle lighting times are determined from latitude and
longitude, a process called geocoding is used to determine the
geographic position of a zip code.  Your zip code is looked up in a
geocoded database of about 42,000 zip codes (<a
href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/zip1999.html">1999 ZIP
Code</a> data from the <a
href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places.html">U.S. Census
Bureau's Gazetteer</a> project).</p>

<p>The Gazetteer data from 1999 is much more complete than their
data from 1990 -- but still not as good as the commercial-quality data
you get from the U.S. Post Office.  Gazetteer contains zip code, city
name, latitude and lognitude but is missing time zone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Gazetteer data contain a FIPS code (which represents
the county a zipcode is part of).  The U.S. National Weather Service
provides <a
href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/catalog/county/html/county.htm">county-timezone
data</a> (keyed on FIPS code), which contains timezone and Daylight
Saving Time data for each county.  By joining these two data sources, we
can get a complete picture of each zip code.</p>

<h3><a name="geo"></a>How can I look up candle-lighting times for any
city in the world?</h3>

<p>Example: how to find candle-lighting times for San Jose, Costa
Rica.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names at <a
    href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/">http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/</a>
<li>Type "San Jose" in the Find box and click "Search" button
<li>Click on the link that says "San Jose, Costa Rica, inhabited place"
<li>Note the latitude/longitude represented in "degrees minutes direction"
    (in the example of San Jose, Costa Rica it is <b>Lat: 09 56 N</b>
    and <b>Long: 084 05 W</b>) and
    write this information down on a sheet of paper
<li>Go to the Hebcal Interactive Jewish Calendar at <a
    href="http://www.hebcal.com/hebcal/">http://www.hebcal.com/hebcal/</a>
<li>In the "Candle lighting times" section, click on the link that says
    "<a href="http://www.hebcal.com/hebcal/?c=on;geo=pos">select by
    latitude/longitude</a>"
<li>Type the latitude and longitude into the form (9 degrees, 56 minutes
    North Latitude, 84 degrees 5 minutes West Longitude)
<li>Select the <b>Time zone</b> and <b>Daylight Saving Time</b> options
    specific to your location
<li>Click "Get Calendar" button at the bottom of the form
</ol>

<h3><a name="dst"></a>What are the Daylight Saving Time options?</h3>

<p>Hebcal offers 4 options for DST:</p>
