<h1>Torah Readings, Sedra Schemes, Triennial Readings</h1>

<h3><a name="scheme">What is the differerence between the Disaspora and
Israeli sedra schemes?</a></h3>

<p>Jews living in the Diaspora (outside of modern Israel) typically
observe two days of chag on holidays that are Yom Tov (holidays where
work is forbidden, called <em>yontiff</em> in Yiddish).  In Israel, only
one day of chag is observed.</p>

<p>Sometimes, depending on the calendar, the Diaspora observes the
second day of chag on Shabbat, and the holiday Torah reading pushes the
regular weekly Torah reading back a week.  Since Israel has only one day
of chag, they read the regular weekly Torah reading.  Thus, the Parsha
Hashavuah ends up being different.</p>

<h3><a name="triennial">What is the Triennial Torah Reading Cycle?</a></h3>

<blockquote>"Many congregations pattern their weekly Torah reading cycle
after a system similar to the one used in ancient Israel during the
rabbinic period. In this system, the traditional parashiot are each
divided into three shorter segments, and the whole Torah is completed
once every three years. The system has both advantages and
disadvantages, but its ability to shorten the length of Torah reading
without sacrificing the complete reading of the Torah on a regular basis
has made it the choice of some synagogues in the Conservative
Movement."</blockquote>
