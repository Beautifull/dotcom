<h1>About Jewish Holidays</h1>

<h3><a name="default"></a>What are the holidays that Hebcal displays?</h3>

<p>For a complete list, see the collection of <a
href="/holidays/">Jewish Holidays</a> pages.</p>

<h3><a name="begin"></a>When do the Holidays begin?</h3>

<p>All Jewish Holidays begin the evening before the date specified.  This
is because the Jewish day actually begins at sundown on the previous
night.  Sometimes, for clarity, the Erev Holiday is also included.</p>

<h3><a name="chol"></a>What does CH''M mean?</h3>

<p><strong>CH''M</strong> is an abbreviation for Chol Ha-Mo'ed.  Chol
Ha-Mo'ed are the intermediate days of Passover and Sukkot, when work is
permitted.</p>

<h3><a name="sunday-fast-days"></a>Why are fixed fast days sometimes
observed on a different day?</h3>

<p>For example, Tzom Tammuz is always on the 17th of Tammuz, but in the
year 5772 (2012 C.E.) it is on the 18th of Tammuz. The answer has to do
with Shabbat:</p>

<blockquote>"The Hebrew year contains several fast days that, though
specified by particular Hebrew calendar dates, are shifted when those
days occur on Saturday. The fast days are Tzom Gedaliah (Tishri 3), Tzom
Tevet (Tevet 10), and Tishah be-Av (Av 9). When Purim is on Sunday,
Ta'anit Esther occurs on the preceding Thursday... Each of the other
fast days, as well as Shushan Purim (the day after Purim, celebrated in
Jerusalem), is postponed to the following day (Sunday) when it occurs on
Saturday."</blockquote>
