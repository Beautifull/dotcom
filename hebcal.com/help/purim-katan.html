<h1>Purim Katan</h1>

(Reprinted from
<tt>http://www.quickcom.net/chabad/html/purim_katan.html</tt>)

<p><strong>Purim Katan</strong> is a rare guest that deserves special
attention.  In the 19-year cycle of regular and leap years we have
nineteen Purims, but only seven Purim Katans.  We must truly utilize
it for special activities.</p>

<p>There's a strong connection between Purim and Purim Katan.  The
Mishnah teaches: "There is no difference between the first Adar and
the second Adar, but the reading of the Megillah and the distribution
of gifts to the poor."  (Megillah 6b)</p>

<p>Otherwise, both Purims are the same, with Purim Katan being
first!</p>

<p>The theme of both is Jewish victory over enemies: "And it turned
about: the Jews gained the upper hand over their adversaries." (Esther
9:2).  So much so, that: "Many from among the people of the land
professed themselves as Jews." (ibid 8:17).  Others were overcome with
the "fear of the Jews," and deferred to them because "The fear of
Mordechai had fallen upon them".  (ibid 9:3)</p>

<p>Purim Katan, too, carries this influence of evoking and eliciting
the assistance and cooperation of the nations for the Jewish
people.</p>

<p>In 5687 (1927), the previous Rebbe said the Maamar, "V'kibel
Hayehudim" on Purim Katan, in the largest synagogue in the capital
city of Russia, before a huge crowd.  He didn't consider the dangers,
and exhibited superhuman self-sacrifice. </p>

<p>The Maamar discusses the reaffirmation of Kabollas HaTorah of the
Jewish people, in the time of Mordechai.  This came through the
self-sacrifice of Mordechai for the Torah studies of the small
children.  Their Torah and self-sacrifice nullified the decree: "Out
of the mouths of children and nursing babies You fashioned an
invincible might... to end foe and avenger."  (Tehillim 8:3).
Education of children is necessary for Jewish existence.</p>

<p>As you educate the child so he grows and develops and will teach
his children, and they, their children, forever.  The dedication to
educating the young generation was the essence of the reaffirmation in
Mordechai's tiem, with an eternal force, so that "The remembrance
shall not perish from their descendants" (ibid 9:28)</p>

<p>The "children and nursing babies" referred to in the Maamar are
infants.  The foundation given such young children, e.g., when their
mothers sing to them lullabies about the greatness of Torah, sets the
foundation for their upbringing and destroys the enemy.</p>

<p>The previous Rebbe stressed the importance of Jewish education and
didn't show fear of the enemy, emphasizing that the work for Jewish
education would destroy the enemy.  In fact, he explained, those who
were foes would become allies and assist in the holy work.  All of
Torah would be reaffirmed in the broadest possible way.</p>

<p>Thus, the lesson of Purim Katan: If there arises "a foe and
avenger" against Yiddishkeit, Torah and Mitzvos, not only must we not
lose hope, but we must increase our activities in all areas of
Yiddishkeit.  Start with establishing the "invincible might" (through
raising infants and babies to all aspects of Torah), which ends the
foe.  In fact, just a "Many from among the people of the land
professed themselves Jews," during the redemption of Purim, the foe is
transformed, and assists in spreading Torah.</p>

<p>This leads to the ultimate redemption.  First we reach the
redemption of Purim, when Mordechai became great and the condition of
the Jews improved.  (Soon after the miracle of Purim, work on the Beis
Hamikdash started again in the days of Darius.)  Then we bring close
the redemption of Purim and Pesach to the ultimate redemption.</p>

<p>May all these forces be utilized properly, to become a partner with
HaShem, to reach the level of "Ad Lo Yoda", beyond understanding and
measure, which is the theme of Purim, but is even stronger on Purim
Katan, because of its rarity.</p>

<p>May this all bring to action, from now into the future, from the
redemption of Purim Katan to the true and ultimate redemption!
(Sichah, Purim Katan, 5746)</p>
