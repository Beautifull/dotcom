hebcal.com source code
======

A mixture of Perl CGI.pm and PHP.

hebcal.com depends on https://github.com/mjradwin/hebcal, currently a fork of the mainline https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal repository.

The only difference between the main hebcal/hebcal program and the mjradwin fork is the use of a different sunrise/sunset algorithm that supports Olson tzdb timezones.
